# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Round 1

### Day 1: March 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned a bit about Ruby on Rails and built out the framework to a basic todo list app with user authentication.

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure how I feel about Ruby itself yet, but I really like how quickly and easily you can get everything going for a basic project using Rails. It really does make things easy. I could see this being a good solution for building something like my amateur radio logbook or a replacement for my static blog site.

**Link to work:** Not yet...
