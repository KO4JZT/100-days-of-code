# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Started April 14, 2021

## Round 1

### Day 1: April 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Deployed a completely new version of my site!

**Thoughts:** I'm really liking 11ty as a static site generator - it's a lot less clutter and more centered around customization. I'm thinking I'll use this over Jekyll in the future. Tomorrow I need to do at least 1 project write-up paired with code.

### Day 2: April 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Got some responsive fixes, layout fixes, and SEO work done on the site. Setup a dev environment for Rails. 

**Thoughts:** I'm enjoying the ability to push through my whole list of project ideas, and can't wait to write baout some of them.

### Day 3: April 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added CRUD to contacts app and learned about how Ruby does partials.

### Day 4: April 18, 2012

**Today's Progress**: Added user authentication and styling to Heimdall.

**Thoughts:** Ruby's system for code by page is a little confusing but I'm happy that I'm able to pick things up as I find them.

**Link to work:** Not yet published.
