# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Started April 14, 2021

## Round 1

### Day 1: April 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Deployed a completely new version of my site!

**Thoughts:** I'm really liking 11ty as a static site generator - it's a lot less clutter and more centered around customization. I'm thinking I'll use this over Jekyll in the future. Tomorrow I need to do at least 1 project write-up paired with code.
